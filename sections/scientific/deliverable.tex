\section{Scientific Deliverables}

In this section, the defined scientific deliverables will be presented. The architecture of an attention-based sequence to sequence model will be investigated and compared to other state-of-the-art models. Further, the Mel Filterbanks features will be introduced and it will be shown how to extract them from the data set. Finally, the model's performance trained on the Librispeech dataset will be assessed while using different hyperparameters.
