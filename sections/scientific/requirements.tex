\subsection{Requirements}
% Describe here all the properties that characterize the deliverables you
% produced. It should describe, for each main deliverable, what are the expected
% functional and non functional properties of the deliverables, who are the actors
% exploiting the deliverables. It is expected that you have at least one
% scientific deliverable (e.g. ``Scientific presentation of the Python programming
% language'', ``State of the art on quality models for human computer
% interaction'', \ldots.) and one technical deliverable (e.g. ``BSProSoft - A
% python/django web-site for IT job offers retrieval and analysis'', \ldots). \\

\begin{itemize} 
  \item \textbf{FR01} Present the feature extraction of Filter banks. \\
  % \item \textbf{FR02} Investigate the notions of deep learning and Artificial
  %   Neural Networks (ANNs).\\
  %   This should give an introduction to the domain of deep learning. It presents
  %   an overview of four different ANNs architectures, each of them covered by a
  %   brief introduction and theoretical
  %   aspect.\\
  % \item \textbf{NFR01} Performance evaluation and comparison.\\ 
  %   During this section, we present and discuss the results obtained using four
  %   Neural Network architectures.
\end{itemize}
