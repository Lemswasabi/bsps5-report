\subsection{Targeted Deliverables}

\subsubsection{Scientific deliverables}

The scientific aspect covered by this Bachelor Semester Project is the architecture of an attention-based sequence to sequence models. The focus of the scientific presentation will be on the architecture of this model and how it compares to other state-of-the-art models. Further, the model's performance will be assessed when using different hyperparameters. Another important deliverable is to present the extraction of Mel Filterbanks features from the dataset.  

\subsubsection{Technical deliverables} 

The technological aspect of this project is the reuse and adaptation of an existing implementation of an attention-based speech recognition model. Additionally, the LibriSpeech dataset will be preprocessed and used for the model’s training. The goal is to deploy its training on an HPC environment for efficient computing.
