\section{Introduction}

This paper presents the Bachelor Semester Project (BSP) made by Le Minh Nguyen together with Vladimir Despotovic as his motivated tutor. The main objective of this project is to present the architecture of an attention-based speech recognition model. An additional objective is to reuse an existing implementation of the attention-based model, adapt it to the scope of this project and compare its performance to the results of other state-of-the-art speech recognition models. Furthermore, the implemented speech recognition model should be trained on the LibriSpeech dataset which contains a large-scale corpus of read English speech. Finally, its performance will be assessed with different sets of tuned hyperparameters.
