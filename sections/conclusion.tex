\section{Conclusion}

In this Bachelor Semester Project report, the Listen, Attend and Spell architecture was presented. An existing implementation of the LAS model was reused to train it on the LibriSpeech dataset. A few experiments with different sets of hyperparameters were carried out. Furthermore, the performances were assessed and compared to other state-of-the-art speech recognition models\sout{ which can be found}\textcolor{red}{, as shown} in Table \ref{table:result_comparison}. Finally, we presented the usage and training of the LAS implementation in an HPC environment as well as \sout{our} \textcolor{red}{the} program to extract the Mel-filterbanks from the speech dataset.
