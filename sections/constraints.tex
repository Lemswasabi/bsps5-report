\subsection{Constraints}

For this BSP, we set the different constraints for the speech data set and the LAS model implementation.\\

% , for the speech
% recognition, for the Luxembourgish vocal dataset and the classification model's
% implementation.\\

\textbf{Data set.} This project does not focus on collection of a data set.  we
focus on training our model on a dataset containing English spoken
numbers.~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1804-03209}

\textbf{ANNs implementation.} We do not implement the Artificial Neural Networks
architecture since existing deep learning libraries such as Keras are already
matured. Thereby, we focus on explaining how the APIs work and how to use them
efficiently in our model.

% \textbf{Speech recognition.} Since no datasets with continuous sentences of the
% Luxembourgish Language exists, we choose to work with isolated word recognition
% instead of continuous speech recognition. In isolated word recognition, words are
% separated by pauses.\\

% \textbf{Speaker dependency.} To simplify the collection of the Luxembourgish
% dataset, we collect the audio recordings from one person which makes the
% isolated word recognition speaker-dependent.\\
