\subsection{Constraints}

For this BSP, we set different constraints for the speech data set and the LAS model implementation.\\

\textbf{Data set.} This project does not focus on the collection of a data set. The focus lies on training our model on the LibriSpeech corpus which is an English data set containing approximately 1000 hours of read English speech. This data set is gathered from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project. ~\cite{panayotov2015librispeech}\\

\textbf{LAS implementation.} We do not implement the LAS architecture from the ground up since various implementation already exists. Therefore, the focus will lie on choosing a mature existing implementation, explaining its structure and how to use it efficiently for our benchmark.\\
