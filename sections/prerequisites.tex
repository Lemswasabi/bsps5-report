\section{Pre-requisites} 

tart on the project, certain skills in programming and mathematics are
required. In particular, the preliminary requirements of the project is as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduction to deep learning-based speech recognition
  \item Knowledge of machine learning, data preprocessing and model training
  \item Introductory course in Python
  \item Understanding of vector and matrix algebra
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scientific pre-requisites}

\textbf{Speech recognition.}\\

\textbf{Machine learning, data preprocessing and model training.}\\

\textbf{Linear Algebra.} A sub-field of mathematics, which works with vectors
and matrices. Since the input of deep learning is data that are transformed
into structures of rows and columns, linear algebra is one of the key
foundations of deep learning. It is used to describe the operations of the deep
learning algorithms, and implement the algorithms in code. All tasks in deep
learning relate to linear algebra, from data preprocessing to the deep learning
algorithms.~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}

\subsection{Technical pre-requisites}

\textbf{Python} is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming
language, which is conceived in the late 1980s and released in 1991 by Guido
van Rossum.~\cite{PyRo} Its design philosophy accentuates readability of the
code.  As many high-level programming languages, Python is dynamically typed.
Further, it supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural,
object-oriented and functional programming. With a proficient background in
programming in Python gained during my high school and university education, I
am prepared to work on this project.\\

% \textbf{Software development.} Software development is the process of designing
% and implementation of applications and frameworks. In general, the process of
% software development includes writing and maintaining the source code which is
% often a planned and structured process. The software development contains mostly
% research, prototyping, modification and reuse of existing software. During the
% technical deliverable section, we use this structured process to design and
% implement our ANNs.
