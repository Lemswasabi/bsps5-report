\section{Technical Deliverables} 

% As technical deliverables, the four ANN models are implemented in Python using
% the Keras\cite{chollet2015keras} library and a small dataset containing
% Luxembourgish spoken words is collected.

The technological aspect of this project is the reuse and adaptation of an existing implementation of an attention-based speech recognition model. Additionally, the LibriSpeech dataset will be preprocessed and used for the model’s training. The goal is to deploy its training on an HPC environment for efficient computing.
