\section{Technical Deliverables} 

The technological aspect of this project is the reuse and adaptation of an existing implementation of an attention-based speech recognition model. Additionally, the LibriSpeech dataset is preprocessed and used for the model’s training. The goal is to deploy its training in an HPC environment for efficient computing.
