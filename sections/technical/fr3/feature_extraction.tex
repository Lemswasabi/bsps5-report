\subsubsection{FR03: Introduce a feature extraction program for the LibriSpeech dataset.}

In this section, we present program which extracts the Mel-filterbank features from the LibriSpeech dataset. The program executes the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item process\_flac2wav()\\

		This function parses the LibriSpeech file directories and converts all audio files, formatted as FLAC files, to WAV files.\\

	\item process\_wav2speech\_feature()\\

		This function parses the LibriSpeech file directories and extracts the Mel-filterbanks from the WAV files.\\

	\item process\_speech\_feature2dataset(train\_file\_list, train\_path, 'train.CSV')\\

		This function creates a CSV file for the training dataset which contains examples with the file path to the extracted features and their label.\\

	\item process\_speech\_feature2dataset(dev\_file\_list, dev\_path, 'dev.CSV')\\

		This function creates a CSV file for the validation dataset which contains examples with the file path to the extracted features and their label.\\

	\item process\_speech\_feature2dataset(test\_file\_list, test\_path, 'test.CSV')\\

		This function creates a CSV file for the testing dataset which contains examples with the file path to the extracted features and their label.\\

	\item save\_vocab()\\

		This function saves the character vocabulary list to a CSV file.\\

\end{enumerate}

A listing of this program is provided in the Appendix.
